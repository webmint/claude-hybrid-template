## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `/onboard` command — deep codebase scan and documentation generation for existing projects
  - Delegates all scanning and writing to the tech-writer agent in onboarding mode
  - Context-safe: uses subagent parallelism, smart extraction, and fixed-size output contracts
  - Size-based scan strategies: direct (< 50 files), subagent-per-module (50-200), two-pass (200-1000), sample-based (1000+)
  - Generates real `docs/` content: `overview.md`, `architecture.md`, `features/*.md`, `api/*.md`
  - Enriches `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` with module boundaries, dependency warnings, and complexity areas
  - Run once after `/constitute` for existing projects

### Changed
- Tech-writer agent template now supports two operating modes: Normal (task docs) and Onboarding (deep scan)
- Workflow updated: `/setup-wizard` → `/constitute` → `/onboard` → `/clarify` → `/specify` → ...
- `/constitute` now recommends `/onboard` as next step for existing projects
- `/setup-wizard` next steps mention `/onboard` for existing projects
- `/execute-task` Phase 1.2 clarifies that `docs/` is populated by `/onboard` for existing projects
- CLAUDE.md template updated with `/onboard` in workflow diagram and command list
- Template manifest updated to include `onboard.md` as template-owned
