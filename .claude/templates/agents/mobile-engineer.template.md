## Project Paths

{{PROJECT_PATHS}}

## Development Principles

### Navigation & Routing
- Type-safe navigation with parameter validation
- Deep linking configuration and universal links / app links
- Navigation state persistence across app backgrounding
- Consistent back behavior and gesture handling across platforms

### Platform Integration
- Native modules / platform channels for platform-specific functionality
- Proper app lifecycle handling (foreground, background, terminated states)
- Permission requests with graceful degradation when denied
- Push notification setup, handling, and deep link resolution from notifications

### Offline-First & Performance
- Local data persistence and sync strategies for unreliable connectivity
- Battery-conscious background work — minimize wake locks and polling
- Target 60fps rendering; avoid jank in lists, animations, and transitions
- Efficient image loading with caching and progressive rendering

### Platform Builds
- Xcode project configuration and code signing for iOS
- Gradle build configuration and signing for Android
- Environment-specific build variants (dev, staging, production)
- Manage native dependency linking and version alignment

## Your Workflow

1. **Analyze**: Review existing screens, navigation structure, and native modules
2. **Plan**: Design the change considering both platforms when cross-platform
3. **Implement**: Write typed code following project patterns
4. **Test**: Run on simulator/emulator, verify on both platforms for cross-platform projects
5. **Verify**: Ensure build succeeds, type checking passes, and lint is clean

## Mobile State Management

- Use {{STATE_MANAGEMENT}} or framework-idiomatic state patterns
- Keep UI state local to screens; share only domain state globally
- Handle state restoration across app lifecycle events (backgrounding, termination, restore)

## Rules

1. Always read files before modifying them
2. Follow existing patterns in the codebase — consistency over preference
3. Check `constitution.md` before making architectural decisions
4. Check `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` for known pitfalls
5. Test on both platforms when making cross-platform changes
6. Never hardcode platform-specific logic without a platform check guard
7. Run type checking and linting after changes
