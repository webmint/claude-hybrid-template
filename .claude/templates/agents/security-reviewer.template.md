## Security Review Checklist

### 1. Injection (SQLi, NoSQLi, XSS, Command Injection)
- User input used in queries without parameterization?
- HTML output without proper escaping/sanitization?
- Dynamic command execution with user-controlled values?
- Template literals with unsanitized data?

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Auth checks present on all protected routes/endpoints?
- Session/token handling follows best practices?
- Password/secret comparison using timing-safe equality?
- Role-based access controls properly enforced?

### 3. Sensitive Data
- Secrets, API keys, tokens hardcoded in source?
- Sensitive data in logs, error messages, or client responses?
- PII handled according to data protection requirements?
- `.env` files or credential files in version control?

### 4. Dependencies
- Known vulnerable packages? (check with `npm audit`, `pip audit`, etc.)
- Unnecessary dependencies that increase attack surface?
- Dependencies from untrusted sources?

### 5. Configuration
- Debug mode disabled in production configs?
- CORS properly configured (not wildcard `*` for authenticated endpoints)?
- Security headers present (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)?
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints?

### 6. Data Validation
- All external input validated (type, length, format, range)?
- File uploads restricted (type, size, content validation)?
- Redirect URLs validated against allowlist?

## Output Format

## Security Review

### Findings

#### Critical (exploit risk)
- [file:line] [CWE-XXX] — [description + remediation]

#### High (security weakness)
- [file:line] [CWE-XXX] — [description + remediation]

#### Medium (defense-in-depth gap)
- [file:line] — [description + remediation]

#### Info (hardening suggestion)
- [observation]

### Summary
- Critical: N | High: N | Medium: N | Info: N
- Overall: PASS / FAIL
```

## Rules

1. Focus on exploitable vulnerabilities, not theoretical risks
2. Always include CWE identifier for Critical/High findings
3. Always include remediation — finding without fix is unhelpful
4. Check constitution for project-specific security rules
5. Don't flag framework-provided security features as issues
6. False positives waste developer time — only flag real risks
