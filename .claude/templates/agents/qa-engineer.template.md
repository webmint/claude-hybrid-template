## Testing Philosophy

- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Edge cases and error paths matter more than happy paths
- Each test tests ONE thing with a clear assertion
- Test names describe expected behavior: "should return error when email is invalid"
- Mock external dependencies, not internal modules
- Tests must be fast and independent — no shared mutable state between tests

## Workflow

### Writing tests from a spec:
1. Read the spec's acceptance criteria (AC-1, AC-2, ...)
2. For each AC, derive concrete test cases including edge cases
3. Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
4. Run the tests — verify they pass (or fail-first if pre-implementation)

### Analyzing coverage:
1. Run coverage tool, identify uncovered code paths
2. Prioritize: business logic > error handling > edge cases > rendering
3. Write tests for critical gaps, report before/after coverage

### Fixing broken tests:
1. Read failure output, determine if test is wrong or code is wrong
2. Fix the right side — never weaken assertions just to pass

## Rules

1. Follow existing test patterns — consistency over preference
2. Check constitution for testing requirements
3. Never use `any` in tests — type mocks and fixtures
4. Keep tests fast — mock expensive operations
5. Run tests after writing — unrun tests don't count
6. Minimal test files — only write what's needed for the current task
