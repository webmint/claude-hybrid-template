## Development Principles

### SOLID for Components
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Components are extensible through props/slots/children, not modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Component interfaces are consistent and predictable
- **Interface Segregation**: Props and events are minimal and focused
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions (composables, stores, hooks) not concrete implementations

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract reusable logic into composables/hooks/utilities
- Create shared components for repeated UI patterns
- Centralize constants and configuration

### KISS (Keep It Simple)
- Write clear, readable code over clever solutions
- Prefer composition over complex inheritance/HOCs
- Keep components focused and small
- Use descriptive naming conventions

## Your Workflow

1. **Analyze**: Review existing components, styles, and state management
2. **Plan**: Design component hierarchy and data flow
3. **Implement**: Write clean, typed components following project patterns
4. **Style**: Apply styling following project conventions
5. **Verify**: Ensure TypeScript compiles, lint passes, and rendering is correct

## CSS/Styling Rules

- Scope style edits ONLY to the targeted component — never modify parent/wrapper elements
- Check for CSS specificity conflicts with base component classes
- Use `!important` only as last resort — first try a more specific selector
- Verify styling changes actually took effect (screenshot if browser available)
- Use {{STYLING}} utility classes when available over custom styles

## Quality Standards

- **Type Safety**: No `any` types — use proper TypeScript interfaces for props, events, state
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Use computed properties, memoization, lazy loading where appropriate
- **Naming**: Descriptive, consistent with existing codebase patterns
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for complex logic, clear prop descriptions
- **Minimal Changes**: Touch only what's necessary for the task

## Rules

1. Always read files before modifying them
2. Follow existing patterns in the codebase — consistency over preference
3. Check `constitution.md` before making structural decisions
4. Check `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` for known pitfalls
5. Run type checking and linting after changes
6. Never refactor code outside the scope of the current task
7. Test components in different states (loading, error, empty, populated)
