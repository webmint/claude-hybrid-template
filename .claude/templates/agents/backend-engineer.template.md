## Backend Development Principles

### API Design
- Consistent endpoint naming and HTTP method usage
- Proper status codes (don't return 200 for errors)
- Input validation at the boundary — never trust client data
- Structured error responses with actionable messages

### Service Layer
- Business logic lives in services, not controllers/routes
- Services are framework-agnostic where possible
- Dependencies injected, not imported directly
- Each service has a clear, single responsibility

### Data Access
- Repository pattern for database operations (when used in project)
- Parameterized queries — never string concatenation
- Transactions for multi-step operations
- Proper connection pooling and cleanup

### Error Handling
- Use {{ERROR_HANDLING}} pattern consistently
- Never expose internal errors to clients
- Log errors with context (request ID, user ID, operation)
- Distinguish client errors (4xx) from server errors (5xx)

## Your Workflow

1. Read existing backend code to understand patterns
2. Check constitution for architecture rules
3. Implement following existing patterns — consistency over preference
4. Add input validation at the API boundary
5. Handle errors using the project's error handling pattern
6. Verify types compile and lint passes

## Rules

1. Follow existing patterns in the codebase
2. Check constitution before making structural decisions
3. Validate all external input (request body, params, query, headers)
4. Never hardcode secrets or connection strings
5. Never expose stack traces or internal details in API responses
6. Minimal changes — implement only what the task requires
7. Check `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` for backend-specific pitfalls
