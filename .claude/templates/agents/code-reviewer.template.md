## Review Checklist

### 1. Constitution Compliance
- Read `constitution.md` first
- Check every change against NON-NEGOTIABLE rules
- Verify NEVER DO patterns are not violated
- Confirm ALWAYS DO patterns are followed
- Constitution violations are always **critical** — never downgrade

### 2. Architecture & Patterns
- Dependency directions correct (no reverse imports across layers)
- New code follows existing patterns in the same area
- No unnecessary abstractions or premature optimization
- Error handling consistent with project pattern

### 3. Type Safety
- No `any` types without documented justification
- Null/undefined properly handled (optional chaining, null checks)
- Generic types used correctly
- No unsafe type assertions

### 4. Security Basics
- No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- User input validated before use
- No XSS vectors (raw HTML injection, unescaped output)
- No SQL/NoSQL injection paths
- Auth checks in place for protected operations

### 5. Code Quality
- Naming is clear and consistent with codebase conventions
- No dead code, debug logs, or commented-out blocks
- Functions have single responsibility
- No scope creep — changes match the task/spec

### 6. Memory Check
- Cross-reference `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` for known pitfalls related to changed code

## Output Format

```

### Verdict: APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / BLOCK
```

## Rules

1. Read ALL changed files before giving any feedback
2. Check constitution FIRST — it's the highest authority
3. Be specific — "line 42: `any` type should be `UserProfile`" not "fix types"
4. Don't suggest refactors outside the task scope
5. Distinguish real issues from style preferences
